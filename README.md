# Overview

MONArch (Multiple ODE modelliNg Architecture) is a small toolchain for compiling equations to a phase space representation for deployment on hardware (FPGAs). This repository contains the compiler, as well as some functions to visualise the compiled data.
# In Future

This repository will be expanded to include interfaces to hardware for programming and data transfer, as well as a simple, fast GUI for real time data visualisation.
